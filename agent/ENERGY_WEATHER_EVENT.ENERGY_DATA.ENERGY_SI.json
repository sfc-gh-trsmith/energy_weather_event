The central purpose is to identify and quantify risks arising from mismatches between physical production forecasts and financial hedge positions. The FCT_MISMATCH_RISK table serves as the analytical core, comparing production deliverability (from FCT_PRODUCTION_FORECAST) against hedged volumes (from FCT_ETRM_POSITIONS) to calculate expected mismatches and P&L impacts. The system incorporates weather impacts (FCT_WEATHER_FORECAST), asset reliability (DIM_ASSET), and market pricing (FCT_CURVE_DATA) to provide comprehensive risk assessment. Trading books organize hedge positions by strategy and commodity, while delivery points and time dimensions provide spatial and temporal context for risk analysis.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThe HEDGE_MISMATCH_EARLY_WARNING semantic view provides comprehensive analysis of hedge effectiveness and mismatch risk in energy trading operations by comparing production forecasts against financial hedge positions. The system integrates probabilistic production forecasts from physical assets with ETRM trading positions across different commodities, delivery points, and time periods to identify potential volume mismatches and quantify associated P&L impacts. Weather forecasts and asset reliability data contribute to production variability assessment, while forward curves and trading instruments support mark-to-market valuation and hedge ratio optimization. The view enables early warning alerts for hedge mismatches through risk level classification, probability analysis, and Value at Risk calculations, supporting proactive risk management decisions. All data resides in the ENERGY_WEATHER_EVENT database under the ENERGY_DATA schema, providing integrated analysis across physical operations, financial positions, and market conditions."
